This is my Portfolio 

I have my name in the top left corner with nav bar in the same line.

The nav bar are clickable links that lead you to desired part of the page.

In the main there are 3 sections the about me, work, and contact section.

I the work section there are 4 photos acting as projects since I haven't completed any yet.

The largest photo is represting my "first project"

When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

 I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
